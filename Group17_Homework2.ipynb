    "1. CBS has come up with an extreme TV show, and each of its viewers either likes or hates it. (no middle ground here; we are in a 'black and white age'). CBS wants to estimate what fraction $p$ of its audience like the show by 'randomly' calling $n$ viewers and tallying their responses so as to estimate the true value of $p$ to a fractional  accuracy of within $\\pm \\epsilon$%, with a confidence of $(1-\\alpha) \\times 100$%. For $\\alpha =  0.1$, $\\epsilon = 0.02$ (i.e. your answer will be $\\hat{p} \\pm 0.02$), what is the minimum value of $n$ needed if (i) true value $p = 0.5$ and (ii) $p = 0.95$? \n",
    "%(First try to do this yourself knowing that you have a binomial distribution, which can be approximated by a normal distribution. If you cannot, consult an undergrad stats book.)\n",
    "2. Suppose for a certain value  of $p$ and choice of $\\epsilon$, you calculate that you will need (at least) 1000 samples for $\\alpha = 0.1$. You now decide to obtain  a more accurate answer by either (i) reducing $\\alpha$ to 0.05, keeping the same $\\epsilon$ or by (ii) reducing $\\epsilon$ by a factor of 2 from the original value, but maintaining  $\\alpha = 0.1$.  In each case how many samples would you need now?"

    "In this question we will be analyzing text data from one of the recent presidental debates. I have included code below to grab the data for you from the New York Times.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a set of the frequency of utterance of  all the distinct words spoken by candidates, and then use it to create a histogram (with 30 bins) of word counts. Thus a bin is a range of count values and the corresponding \"y\" value is the number of words whose count falls in this range. What is interesting about this distribution? What are the 10 most common words?\n",
    "2. Remove the 100 most common words from vocabulary. Meaning that if you ever see this word, get rid of it. Now create a new python dictionary for each candidate that is a single list of all the words spoken by this candidate (ignoring these most common words). What are the 10 most common words for Trump, Rubio, and Cruz? How do their words differ?\n",
    "3. Using our dictionary from number 2, how many words did each speaker speak? Who spoke the most? Who is the outlier?\n",
    "4. Count the percentage of time each person uses the words (I, I'm, me, mine). When doing this convert all words to lower case. Create a bar plot of this percentage for each candidate with bars from largest to smallest. Use dictionary that has all words (doesn't exclude most common). What does the plot show?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "1. Look at python Counter.\n",
    "2. Just split text on a space. This isn't perfect, but will be fine."
